# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project is about classifying if an applicant should be approved for a loan or not. I have used classification ML algorithms to correctly classify between class 0 (rejection) and class 1 (Approval) 


The major task here is to make sure we reduce approving loans for customers that are not eligible for a loan.  Decision Tree was able to reject 3 out off 4 bad customers.
